# Simple-JS-Race-Game

Simple jQuery/JS race game where BB-8 and BMO have a wee race across the screen.

**Controls**
- Use "q" and "w" alternatively to control BB-8.
- Use "o" and "p" alternatively to control BMO.

To use this in your browser, save the three files to a directory, and open the jsRacer.html file in your browser. Shouldn't be a problem.
